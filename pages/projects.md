### 1. C-SQG: Cosine-Law-Based Spatially Quantized Gait Generation for Knee-Stretched Biped Walking

This is a research topic for the knee-stretched gait patterns generation of the bipedal robots, the paper has been published on the International Journal of Humanoid Robotics (IJHR),  [paper_link](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219843623500329).  The source code for this project is open now at [github]().

#### 2D simulation on the matlab

The knee-stretched bipedal walking simulation in 2D on the Matlab is shown as follows:

</center>

where the left one is with only kinematics calculation, and the right one is with kinematics and dynamics calculation.

#### 3D simulation on the matlab

The knee-stretched bipedal walking simulation in 3D on the Matlab is shown as follows:
